## Introduction

This report examines the critical issue of limited access to handwashing facilities across the globe and its relationship to health outcomes. Using UNICEF data, we analyze how the percentage of populations without access to basic handwashing facilities varies by country and region, and explore the relationship between handwashing access, life expectancy, and economic indicators.

Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions, potentially reducing diarrheal diseases by up to 50% and respiratory infections by 25%. Despite its importance, many people worldwide lack access to basic handwashing facilities, putting them at increased risk of preventable diseases.

# Load the data
unicef_data = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\Swithaja N\Documents\DCU\2nd Sem\Data Analytics\Assignment 2\unicef-report\merged_unicef_data.csv.csv")

# Display the first few rows of the dataset

```

## Regional Analysis of Handwashing Access

To understand regional patterns, we can compare the average percentage of population with limited handwashing access across different regions of the world.

```{python}
#| label: bar-chart
#| fig-cap: "Regional comparison of limited handwashing access"

# Get most recent data for each country
recent_data = unicef_data.sort_values('year').groupby('country').last().reset_index()

# Create a region column by grouping countries
# This is a simplified approach - in a real analysis, you would use a more accurate regional classification
regions = {
    'Africa': ['Afghanistan', 'Algeria', 'Angola', 'Benin', 'Burkina Faso', 'Burundi', 
               'Cameroon', 'Central African Republic', 'Chad', 'Zambia', 'Zimbabwe'],
    'Asia': ['Armenia', 'Azerbaijan', 'Bahrain', 'Bangladesh', 'Bhutan', 'Cambodia', 'China'],
    'Americas': ['Barbados', 'Belize', 'Bolivia, Plurinational State of'],
    'Europe': ['Bosnia and Herzegovina']
}

# Create a region column
def assign_region(country):
    for region, countries in regions.items():
        if country in countries:
            return region
    return 'Other'

recent_data['region'] = recent_data['country'].apply(assign_region)

# Group by region and calculate mean
region_data = recent_data.groupby('region')['limited_handwashing_percent'].mean().reset_index()
region_data = region_data.sort_values(by='limited_handwashing_percent', ascending=False)

# Create the bar chart
(ggplot(region_data, aes(x='region', y='limited_handwashing_percent', fill='region')) +
 geom_bar(stat='identity') +
 theme_minimal() +
 theme(axis_text_x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1),
       figure_size=(10, 6)) +
 labs(title="Average Percentage of Population with Limited Handwashing Access by Region",
      x="Region",
      y="% Population with Limited Access") +
 guides(fill=False))
```

## Impact of Handwashing Access on Health Outcomes

### Relationship Between Handwashing Access and Life Expectancy

This scatter plot explores the relationship between limited handwashing access and life expectancy, with a regression line showing the overall trend.

```{python}
#| label: scatter-plot
#| fig-cap: "Correlation between limited handwashing access and life expectancy"

# Use most recent data for each country
scatter_data = recent_data.dropna(subset=['limited_handwashing_percent', 'Life expectancy at birth, total (years)'])

# Create the scatter plot with regression line
(ggplot(scatter_data, aes(x='limited_handwashing_percent', 
                           y='Life expectancy at birth, total (years)')) +
 geom_point(alpha=0.6) +
 geom_smooth(method='lm', color='blue') +
 theme_minimal() +
 labs(title="Relationship between Limited Handwashing Access and Life Expectancy",
      x="% Population with Limited Handwashing Access",
      y="Life Expectancy at Birth (years)"))
```

```{python}
#| label: regression-stats
#| code-fold: true

# Calculate regression statistics
X = scatter_data['limited_handwashing_percent']
X = sm.add_constant(X)
y = scatter_data['Life expectancy at birth, total (years)']
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
print(model.summary())
```

## Temporal Trends in Handwashing Access

### Changes in Handwashing Access Over Time

The following time series chart shows how limited handwashing access has changed over time in selected countries, allowing us to identify progress or setbacks.

```{python}
#| label: time-series
#| fig-cap: "Trends in limited handwashing access over time in selected countries"

# Select a few countries with complete time series data
countries_to_plot = ['Bangladesh', 'Afghanistan', 'Burkina Faso', 'Cambodia']
time_data = unicef_data[unicef_data['country'].isin(countries_to_plot)]

# Create the time series plot
(ggplot(time_data, aes(x='year', y='limited_handwashing_percent', color='country', group='country')) +
 geom_line(size=1.2) +
 geom_point(size=3) +
 theme_minimal() +
 scale_x_continuous(breaks=range(2000, 2023, 5)) +
 labs(title="Trends in Limited Handwashing Access Over Time",
      x="Year",
      y="% Population with Limited Access") +
 theme(legend_title=element_blank()))
```

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on our analysis of UNICEF data on handwashing access, several key findings emerge:

1. **Geographic Disparities**: The world map visualization reveals significant disparities in access to handwashing facilities, with particularly concerning levels in Africa and parts of Asia.

2. **Health Impact**: Our analysis found a strong negative correlation between handwashing access and life expectancy. Countries with higher percentages of limited handwashing access tend to have lower life expectancy, highlighting the critical role of basic hygiene in public health outcomes.

3. **Progress Over Time**: While some countries have made substantial progress in improving handwashing access over the past two decades, others continue to face significant challenges. The overall trend shows improvement, but the pace varies considerably.

4. **Economic Factors**: Limited handwashing access tends to be more prevalent in countries with lower GDP per capita, suggesting economic constraints play a role in the provision of basic hygiene facilities.

### Recommendations for UNICEF Action

1. **Targeted Interventions**: Focus resources on regions and countries showing the highest percentages of limited handwashing access, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia.

2. **Integrated Approach**: Develop programs that address handwashing access alongside other health determinants, recognizing the strong relationship between hygiene and overall health outcomes.

3. **Economic Support**: Provide economic assistance and infrastructure development support to countries with lower GDP per capita to help them establish sustainable handwashing facilities.

4. **Education Campaigns**: Implement educational campaigns about the importance of handwashing, particularly in areas where access is improving but utilization may still be low.

5. **Monitoring Framework**: Establish robust monitoring systems to track progress in handwashing access, especially in high-need areas, to ensure interventions are effective and sustainable.
